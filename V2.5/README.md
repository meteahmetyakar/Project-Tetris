#### This version is an update for V2.0, there is no change on gameplay but I added 3 board type and game save/load operations.
|Board types    |Description |
|:-----------:|:-|
| Vector | The Board is represented using an STL vector of STL vectors. |
| 1D Dynamic Array | The Board is represented using a 1D Dynamic C Array|
| Adapter | This class takes a template parameters (vector<vector<>>, vector<deque>, deque<vector>, deque<deque>>) and behaves like an adaptor class |

*Because of the library for animation, the program only works on linux systems.*
